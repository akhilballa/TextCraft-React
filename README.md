# React Application Starter Guide

This project was set up using **Create React App** to provide a solid foundation for React development.

## Available Commands

Inside your project folder, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.  
Any saved changes will cause the page to reload automatically.  
You’ll also find any lint warnings or errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in watch mode, letting you interactively run tests related to changed files.  
For more details, check the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Generates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.  
The output bundles React in production mode, minifies files, and includes hashed filenames for caching purposes.  
This build is ready for deployment.

Learn more about deploying your app [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

> **Warning:** This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone!

If you want full access to the underlying configurations (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can run this command. It copies all configuration files and dependencies into your project, giving you complete control.  
All other commands will continue to work, but they will now use the local configuration files.  
Use this only if you need to customize your setup beyond what Create React App supports out of the box.
