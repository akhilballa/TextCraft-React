# React Application Starter

This project was created using **Create React App**, which sets up everything you need for a modern React development environment.

---

## How to Run Locally

To get this project up and running on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install all the required packages:  
   ```bash
   npm install
Start the development server
Once installed, start the app in development mode by running:
npm start
Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action. The page supports hot-reloading, so any changes you make will automatically update.
Running Tests

You can launch the interactive test runner with:
npm test
This command keeps running in watch mode and will run tests related to files you change.
Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:
npm run build
This will bundle your app into static files inside the build directory, ready to be deployed anywhere.


Additional Notes

The dev server reloads automatically when files change, providing a smooth development experience.
Production builds are minified and include content hashes in filenames to help with caching.
For more details on code splitting, PWA support, advanced config, and deployment, check the Create React App documentation linked above.
